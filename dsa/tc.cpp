//Time Complexity:= it is the amount of time taken ny a algorithm to run as a function of length of the input
//big O(o)->worst                theta->average                                sigma->best
//we have to focus in worst case only

//O(1)->constant time(5 times or 6 time or.....)
//O(n)->linear time(n number of times)
//O(n^2)->nested loop for n times(both the for loops have n number of loop)
   



   ////complexity level in ascending order
//    O(1)           '
//    O(log n)       ''
//    O(n)           ...
//    O(n log n)     ....
//    O(n^2)         .....
//    O(n^3)         ......
//    O(2n)          .......

//  we must consider the upperbound
